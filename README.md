Hi, I'm Brittney, owner, designer, and developer at [bDesigned](https://www.bdesigned.dev/). I am a mentor for the [Zero to Mastery Academy](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/?affcode=441520_gjue7n-1), home to over 300k students learning to code. I started teaching myself to code at the end of 2018 while I was a stay at home mom to my 3 wonderful children. I currently mentor students, do live streams on our discord server, tutorial videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyvOaBoW3Jti69U4Gw1ci9Q?view_as=subscriber), and write posts on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/bdesigned) and my digital garden [Console Logs](https://console-logs.netlify.app/). You can find out more about me at [bDesigned](https://www.bdesigned.dev/) or find me below.
