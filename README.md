Hi there 👋, I'm [Brittney Postma](https://brittneypostma.com) I am a passionate community builder and the founder of the [Svelte Sirens](https://sveltesirens.dev), a society for women, non-binary people, and allies to learn, grow, and connect with other Svelte developers. I specialize in crafting scalable and efficient design systems that enables consistency and creativy to each product. Currently, I work for [Provi](https://www.provi.com/careers) as a Staff Design Systems Engineer. I also co-host the [Svelte Radio](https://www.svelteradio.com/) podcast and [Svelte Summit](https://www.sveltesummit.com/). I love helping people in the community and empowering those that don't have a voice to find their place in the tech industry. I previously mentored for the [Zero to Mastery Academy](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/?affcode=441520_gjue7n-1), home to more than 400,000 students learning to code. I have a background in Graphic Design and I love developing beautiful, fluid, and responsive websites using new technologies on the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) especially in Svelte. I thrive on accessible, semantic HTML that also has personality. I want everyone to be included on my websites, but also have some fun! I am very active on Discord, you can find me in [Learn Build Teach](https://learnbuildteach.com/community), [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/discord), [Party Corgi](https://discord.gg/partycorgi), and the [Svelte Discord](https://svelte.dev/chat). You can find posts I've written on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/bdesigned) and on [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/author/brittneypostma/).
