Hi there 👋, I'm Brittney, designer and developer at [bDesigned](https://www.bdesigned.dev/) and [CodingCat.dev](https://codingcat.dev). I am a mentor for the [Zero to Mastery Academy](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/?affcode=441520_gjue7n-1), home to more than 400,000 students learning to code. I have a background in Graphic Design and I love developing beautiful, fluid, and responsive websites using new technologies on the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) and am in love with Svelte 😍. I thrive on accessible, semantic HTML that also has personality. I want everyone to be included on my websites, but also have some fun! You can find posts I've written on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/bdesigned) and my dev notes site [The Console Logs](https://theconsolelogs.com/). You can find out more about me at [bDesigned](https://www.bdesigned.dev/) or any social links above.<br/><br/>
